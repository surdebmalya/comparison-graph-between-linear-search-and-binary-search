# comparison-graph-between-linear-search-and-binary-search

Write two search functions linear search and binary search. 

Create a random array of size n, perform m searches on the array, where the element to be searched is also determined randomly. Calculate the no. of comparisons your function makes. Vary the value of m from m=1,1000, 5000, 8000, 10000. Plot the graph m vs no. of comparisons for both linear and binary search on the same graph. For binary search also consider the number of comparisons of your sorting algorithm on the array which you use only once. Make 3 search graphs for n=1000, 5000, 10000.
